# StackShift Studio

Since the release of StackShift v6, we have introduced a global themeing system for components with Theme Settings.
To learn more about how to use the Theme Settings, please refer to the [Theme Settings guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tN5ZIDQ9cCsGetOFa9lBGDmzUrB9gqtTAxeLsjVTLQk/edit?usp=sharing).
